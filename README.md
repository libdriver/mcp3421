## LibDriver MCP3421

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/mcp3421/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The MCP3421 is a single channel low-noise, high accuracy ΔΣ A/D converter with differential inputs and up to 18 bits of resolution in a small SOT-23-6 package.The on-board precision 2.048V reference voltage enables an input range of ±2.048V differentially (Δ voltage = 4.096V). The device uses a two-wire I2C compatible serial interface and operates from a single 2.7V to 5.5V power supply.The MCP3421 device performs conversion at rates of 3.75, 15, 60, or 240 samples per second (SPS) depending on the user controllable configuration bit settings using the two-wire I2C serial interface. This device has an on-board programmable gain amplifier (PGA). The user can select the PGA gain of x1, x2, x4, or x8 before the analog-to-digital conversion takes place. This allows the MCP3421 device to convert a smaller input signal with high resolution. The device has two conversion modes: (a) Continuous mode and (b) One-Shot mode. In One-Shot mode, the device enters a low current standby mode automatically after one conversion. This reduces current consumption greatly during idle periods.The MCP3421 device can be used for various high accuracy analog-to-digital data conversion applications where design simplicity, low power, and small footprint are major considerations.

LibDriver MCP3421 is a full-featured driver of MCP3421 launched by LibDriver. LibDriver MCP3421 provides continuous mode ADC conversion, single mode ADC conversion and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_mcp3421_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
double s;

/* basic init */
res = mcp3421_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    mcp3421_interface_debug_print("mcp3421: basic init failed.\n");

    return 1;
}

...
    
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* read the data */
    res = mcp3421_basic_read((double *)&s);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        mcp3421_interface_debug_print("mcp3421: basic read failed.\n");
        (void)mcp3421_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    mcp3421_interface_debug_print("mcp3421: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, 3);
    mcp3421_interface_debug_print("mcp3421: adc is %0.4fV.\n", s);
    mcp3421_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...
    
(void)mcp3421_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example shot

```C
#include "driver_mcp3421_shot.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
double s;

/* shot init */
res = mcp3421_shot_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    mcp3421_interface_debug_print("mcp3421: basic init failed.\n");

    return 1;
}

...
    
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* read the data */
    res = mcp3421_shot_read((double *)&s);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        mcp3421_interface_debug_print("mcp3421: basic read failed.\n");
        (void)mcp3421_shot_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    mcp3421_interface_debug_print("mcp3421: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, 3);
    mcp3421_interface_debug_print("mcp3421: adc is %0.4fV.\n", s);
    mcp3421_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...
    
(void)mcp3421_shot_deinit();

return 0;
```
